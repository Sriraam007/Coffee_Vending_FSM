FSM - Finite State Machine is a digital circuit that implements a finite set of states and transitions between these states based on the inputs to the circuit.

Here, in this repository, I have designed an FSM for a Coffee Vending Machine, where one coffee costs 20 rupees. 
The user/customer on buying a coffee, the count of coffee changes correspondingly. Moreover, the balance amount to be returned to the customer is also displayed. 
Hence this FSM explains how the whole process of collecting the money from the customer to displaying the balance amount to be returned is done efficiently using simple combinational and sequential circuits modeled using Verilog HDL
